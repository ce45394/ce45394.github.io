For activity four, we were instructed to do two activities to learn more about how Emails work.
For the first activity, I learned how to send, receive, and respond to emails. The first step of the equation was to select an email provider, and I chose to use Google's built in service known as Gmail.
Gmail is the most popular email service in the world as everyone that creates a Google account is given a Gmail to use. Due to its high popularity and ease of use, it is my optimal choice.
I sent an Email to my professor asking about one of the homework assignments and asked him to clarify when it was due and he replied the following day.
I rewsponded to him thaking him for the information and pressed the send button. It is easy to communicate via email like this without having to share your personal information such as a phone or home address.
The email is one of the best developments in communication as it bridged the gap between paper mail and digital communication such as texting.

The second activity that I completed was learning more in-depth about emails and how they work. There was a lot of information that was written in the links that were provided by Wikiversity.
It made me realize that we are paying hundreds of dollars for links that I could have googled and information that I could have taught myself. Something else that was a part of the activity was learning about
how to write emails as well as adding signatures and headers to them to make them more professional. All of this and more is important to know as emails are very prevalant in almost every modern job.
