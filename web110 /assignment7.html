    <p>For assignment 7 we were tasked with learning about security on the internet. For the first activity, I chose to learn more about different privacy settings.
    There are several different methods of protecting your privacy online, such as settings and services that provide people with an
    easy way of keeping private from others. For example, there are settings that enable people to be hide which text messages are saved by companies when they to talk to others. This is a very efficient method of privacy
    as it keeps companies from storing your personal logs which is convenient for many as you are not always able to trust these large companies with your information. Some apps with these settings
    include Google Messages, Skype, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. All of these applications are free to use and are widely utilized by millions of people around the world.
    
    For the second activity, I chose to learn more about anti malware using antivirus applications. These programs allow you to protect your device without having to physically connect any wires to the central
    device. These can be useful when installing what other people online send you, such as apps you are unfamiliar with. All of this and more is very beneficial to people as it enables them to be secure
    without having to worry about waiting for other people to communicate back. Security apps have been very beneficial to the work environment. My preferred Security application is Windows Defender.</p>
