    <p># First Activity: Comparing different web browsers
# For assignment two, we were instructed to visit the Wikiversity page and complete two activities.
# I began by doing the activity where we installed multiple web browsers. The ones that I chose were Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox.
# Each one of these had several differences, though their most notable differences were visual, as all functioned nearly the same. Each search engine displayed different results at the top.
# Google Chrome's main interface is very simple, only displaying the logo of the company and a search bar below with a magnifying glass that said "Search Google or type a URL."
# Firefox was similar, though it showed the an orange fox instead of the Google logo and below the search bar there were several icons that the user could click to access popular websites.
# These websites included YouTube, Gmail, and Yahoo.
# Microsoft Edge had much more on the main menu, not only including the search bar, but the edge logo made up the entire background of the main page. At the bottom, there were several news articles and widgets that
# the user could interact with. My personal favorite was Google, as it was very simple, straightforward, and easy to use.

# Second Activity: Hands on practice on different web browsers
# The second activity that I completed was practicing using different web brosers. I began by going onto Google and searching up YouTube.com. Afterwards, I went on Firefox and searched Amazon.com. Lastly, I went on
# Edge and searched up Ebay.com. These different sites imitate what a typical internet user would search. People oftentimes use web browsers to buy products, and may want to watch a video of the product to see if it
# is worth it or not. By searching two different shopping sites, it is similar to how people would compare prices across different websites. It is important to understand how the average person uses web browsers in order
# to be able to help people who face tech issues in their homes. This is how I would incorporate this knowledge when on the job.</p>
