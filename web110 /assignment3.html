    <p># First Activity: Comparing Different Search Engines
# For Assignment Three, we were instructed to visit the Wikiversity page and complete two activities. I began by exploring different search engines to compare their features and performance. 
# The ones I chose were Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Each of these search engines had several differences, though their most notable distinctions were in their layout, search results, and privacy policies.
# Google’s main interface was simple, displaying only the company’s logo, a search bar, and a few quick-access links. Bing featured a visually engaging homepage with a background image and trending news stories.
# DuckDuckGo prioritized user privacy, with it having a minimalist interface while blocking trackers and avoiding personalized search results.
# While all three search engines provided relevant information, the ranking of search results varied. Google tended to prioritize well-known websites, while Bing highlighted Microsoft-affiliated content.
# DuckDuckGo delivered unbiased results by avoiding personalized algorithms. Similarly to the previous assignment, my personal favorite was Google due to its speed and accuracy.

# Second Activity: Hands-On Practice with Search Engines
# The second activity involved conducting searches on each engine to compare their effectiveness.
# I first searched “best phone of 2024” on Google, then looked up “top phones” on Bing, and “top phone of 2024” on DuckDuckGo.
# Google displayed results from major tech review sites, while Bing provided a mix of articles, including Microsoft-sponsored content. DuckDuckGo focused on privacy-friendly sources and avoided targeted ads.
# These differences highlight how search engines filter and rank information based on their algorithms and priorities. Understanding how different search engines work is important for finding reliable and unbiased information.
# This knowledge can be useful when doing research, online shopping, and everyday browsing, helping the user make informed decisions.</p>
