    <p># First Activity: Comparing Different Search Engines
# For Assignment Three, we were instructed to visit the Wikiversity page and complete two activities. I began by looking at different search engines to compare their features.
# The ones I chose were Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Each of these search engines had several differences, but the most notable differences were in the layout and search results.
# Google’s main interface was simple. It displayed only the Google logo and a search bar. Bing had a more filled page with a background image and a lot of news stories.
# DuckDuckGo claims it focuses on user privacy. The page had a minimalist interface like Google's while blocking trackers and no personalized search results.
# While all three of them provided relevant information, the ranking of search results varied. Google prioritized famous websites, while Bing wanted to show its own Microsoft-affiliated content.
# DuckDuckGo showed unbiased results because it avoids personalized algorithms. Similarly to the previous assignment, my personal favorite was Google due to its speed and accuracy.

# Second Activity: Hands-On Practice with Search Engines
# The second activity involved doing searches on each engine to compare their effectiveness.
# I first searched “best phone of 2024” on Google, then looked up “top phones” on Bing, and “top phone of 2024” on DuckDuckGo.
# Google displayed results from big tech review sites, while Bing provided a mix of articles, and it had a lot more Microsoft-sponsored content. DuckDuckGo focused on privacy-friendly sources and it also avoided targeted ads.
# This shows how search engines filter and rank information based on their algorithms and priorities. Understanding how different search engines work is important for finding reliable and unbiased information.
# Knowing this information can be useful when doing things like research or shopping. Also, it helps the user make informed decisions.</p>
