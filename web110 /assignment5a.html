    <p>In assignment 5a we were tasked with learning a lot about Social Media and how it works. There are many different aspects to social meida and this part of the course taught us about a lot of them.
For the first activity, I followed the Wikiversity page's instructions on how to sign up for a social media platofrm. The one that I chose was Instagram. By going to instagram's website, I was able to sign up
and make an account for this social media platfrom. After coming up with a username and entering a password two times to confirm it, I was able to view other people's posts and interact with them.
I also installed Instagram on my phone which is the most optimized and primary version of the app. On the mobile app, it is easy to see many different forms of content by just scrolling.
Instagram has an algorithm which caters things you might like depending on what you have interacted with. In this case, the more you like something, the more of that kind of content you will see.
For the second activity, I signed up for Facebook. It was similar to signing up for Instagram as both of these social media apps are owned by Meta Technologies. There was actually an option to sign up using
Instagram as both of them are highly connected. After signing in, it immediately allowed me to see others' posts. Facebook was originally intended for computers, and thus, the user interface is considerably
better on computer as opposed to Instagram's mobile-oriented interface.
I preferred using Instagram as it felt more alive than Facebook. Facebook seems to have a lot of older people on it and they just post what they are thinking or reacting to stuff they saw on the news.
Instagram has a lot of funny posts and is more like a news feed as everything that is being talked about is currently happening. However, I would not use either regularly as I believe that X is better than both of them.
Even then, I wouldn't really care if I had to stop using all Social Media. It's not cool to sit around on apps all day anymore so I would rather go and hang out with people in real life.</p>
