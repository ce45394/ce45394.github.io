    <p>For activity 5b, I completed the first activity which was to choose a Social Media application and talk about why it is my preferred option. For this activity, I chose X as it is my primary
    social media application. I used to use apps like Instagram and Snapchat for social media when I was younger and still in middle school. However, after a while, I stopped really caring about keeping up
    my accounts on either of them as it seemed completely pointless. On Instagram, the only things people post are the best parts of their day and it's very fake-feeling to me as I enjoy living in the good moments
    and don't feel the need to boast about what I am doing to strangers online. Snapchat never felt like a useful or even fun app to use when I had it, I only got it because in middle school everyone was using it
    and it was "cool" to have big streaks with other people. I used Snapchat for about two months before deleting it as the app was just a free texting app and why would I divide my communication with the people I
    care about if I already have their phone numbers? Around 2020, I quit Instagram as I focused on YouTube where people wanted to watch my content instead of just seeing pictures of what I am doing. YouTube
    in my opinion is much more authentic than other Social Media sites as people post videos of them doing what they like instead of flexing on others for likes. The community is much more casual than other sites
    and I still use YouTube daily since it is not only entertaining but also fun to use. In 2022, I began using Twitter/X because it was like a more interactive way of staying up-to-date on world events while also
    being able to communicate with people who had the same interests as myself. On X, people post about their interests rather than posting pictures of themselves with cash and it feels much more genuine. Today, the only social
    media apps that I use are YouTube and X.</p>
