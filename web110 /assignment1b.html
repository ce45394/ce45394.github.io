# Activity: Learning and Understanding File Extensions
# After opening the Wikiversity page and selecting the activities, I decided that I would learn more about file extensions. There are many different types of file extensions, and each of them serve a different purpose.
# Some of these include jpeg, png, psd, pdf, and mcpack.
# The file extension is indicated by a short amount of letters at the end of a file name after a period. Jpegs and Pngs tell the computer that the file is an image, while others, such as Psd, Pdf, and Mcpack, are app-specific.
# Sometimes, you can change a file extension and turn it into something different. For example, I learned through trial and error that you can change WEBP files to Pngs and the image correctly translates.
# I also learned that I was able to change Zip files into McPack files by changing the file extension as long as the folders were set up correctly in the original Zip.
