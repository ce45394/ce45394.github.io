    <p>For assignment 6 we were tasked with learning about communications on the internet. For the first activity, I chose to learn more about VoIP messaging apps.
    There are several different methods of communicating online, such as apps and services that provide people with an
    easy way of communicating with others. For example, there are VoIP messaging services that enable people to be able to send text messages to talk to others. This is a very efficient method of communicating
    as it allows people to talk to eachother without having to be on the phone which is convenient for many as you are not always able to speak when you are in public places for example. Some of these services
    include Google Messages, Skype, WhatsApp, and Snapchat. All of these applications are free to use and are widely utilized by millions of people around the world.
    
    For the second activity, I chose to learn more about screen sharing using remote desktop. These programs allow you to share your screen without having to physically connect any wires to the central
    device. These can be useful when communicating with other people online, such as in remote-work situations. All of this and more is very beneficial to people as it enables them to work from afar
    without having to worry about waiting for people to communicate back. Communications apps have been very beneficial to the work environment. My personal screen sharing app of choice is Discord.</p>
