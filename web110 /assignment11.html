    For assignment 11 we were tasked with learning about database examples and completing the tasks in Wikiversity. For this activity, I followed the instructions and compiled all of the information that
    was required for the fourteen questions. All of the information is listed above. I learned a lot about navigating databases and how to correlate data from one segment of the database to another.
    I used different IDs and connected them to names of things like customers, suppliers, and items for sale. All of this is important to know when working a job that requires skills such as inventory management.</p>
