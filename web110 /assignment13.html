    <p>For assignment 13, we were tasked with preparing for the final Web110 project. I started by following the instructions that were provided in the class page and downloading a Microsoft Excel file
      that would be used to create a chart to see how long everything would take. This is a useful skill as the program "Excel" is a common application in many different jobs that involve computers and data.
      After completing the excel file, I saved it and took a screenshot that is shown attached with this paragraph. This taught me how to add images to an HTML webpage, as I had to create a separate folder
      and upload the image to the repository in order to be able to manually link it using a reference command. These are important skills to know when creating and editing webpages.

      For my final project, I plan to do a 10-minute video slideshow on how to create a simple, stylized webpage. The video will go through creating the code, uploading, and adding images, as well as changing
      the colors of the webpage. The webpage will have a title that has text that is larger than the rest of the site, an embedded image, and CSS styling.
