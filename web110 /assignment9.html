<h1>Assignment 9</h1>
<p>For assignment 9, we were tasked with creating a more customized webpage using CSS. By using this technique, we are able to add much more personality to the webpages beyond just the size and font
of the text when we are writing. By using CSS styles, we can customize the webpage to include a custom color for the background, as well as a custom font and a custom header color.
It's also possible to structure the page differently by using borders and padding the sides of the page to keep everything visible on screen. I learned a lot about customizing and creating pages
with this exercise and it was interesting to see it come together as the code on these other pages built up.

Knowing how to create customizable pages like this is important for any job that involves the internet and customizing pages. It is an extremely useful skill and it was helpful to be able to try it on my own
today with the help of the assignment 9 pages in the assignments list.</p>
