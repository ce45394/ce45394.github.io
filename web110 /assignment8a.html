    <p>Assignment 8 is different than the previous assignments because it is about the content that we have produced and directly tasked us with coding in html for the first time in this class.
    I found it interesting to do some actual coding instead of just the wikiversity summaries and although it is time consuming, it is something new which I enjoyed doing. Working around the problems and
    getting the list to work worked my troubleshooting skills and contributed towards a drive to not give up when faced with issues in the code. I found it intriguing doing my own research online
    and using the provided links on the assignment page to get the links to work. These skills, troubleshooting, patience, and vigor are useful skills that can be applied at a job where coding is a central
    focus and I am glad that I learned some of it today, even if it is mostly simple.</p>
